            The Goodtimes Project is committed to keeping camp cost-free for Western Washington and Alaskan families of kids with cancer and we need your help.  The cost of service is $1,700 per child.  Our goal is to raise $400,000 to carry out the same level of service for 2014 and beyond.  This includes raising funds for camp, supplies, materials, facility rentals, plane tickets for Alaska campers, ground transportation, medical supplies, food and lodging.



            <br /><br />
            <b>The success of camp relies on the generosity of our donors and sponsors​.  Thank you for making a difference in the lives of deserving children and their families.</b>
