    <p class="p-centered">For 30 years, Camp Goodtimes West was funded and operated by the American Cancer Society (ACS). In March 2013, the ACS announced a national shift in spending, which meant funding for programs not directly associated with research, including oncology camps, would be eliminated in December 2013. Friends and volunteers of the camp immediately formed The Goodtimes Project, an independent nonprofit that aims to continue the camp’s legacy of excellence.

In addition to our popular summer camps, we give kids and their families opportunities all year long to laugh, play, sing, dance and make lifelong friends.
